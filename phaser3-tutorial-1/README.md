# Making your first Phaser 3 game

Welcome to our first tutorial on Making a Game with Phaser 3. Here we will learn how to create a small game involving a player running and jumping around platforms, collecting stars and avoiding baddies. While going through this process we'll explain some of the core features of the framework.

## Instructions

To run the game you need a web server. This is explained in the _Getting Started_ guide here http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3.

In IntelliJ IDEA just "run" the index.html file and it will start a web server and open the browser for you.
